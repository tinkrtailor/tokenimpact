          - heading "Why Compare Exchange Liquidity Before Trading" [level=2] [ref=e120]
          - paragraph [ref=e121]: When executing large cryptocurrency orders, the exchange you choose can mean the difference between a profitable trade and an expensive mistake. Each exchange has different orderbook depth - the amount of buy and sell orders at various price levels. Binance typically leads in USDT pair liquidity, while Coinbase and Kraken often have deeper USD orderbooks. For whale traders moving $100K or more, comparing liquidity across Binance vs Coinbase vs Kraken before trading is essential.
        - generic [ref=e122]:
          - heading "How Price Impact Costs You Money" [level=2] [ref=e123]
          - paragraph [ref=e124]: Price impact (also called slippage) occurs when your order is large enough to move the market. Instead of getting the quoted price, you "walk the orderbook" - buying at progressively higher prices or selling at progressively lower prices. A $500K Bitcoin buy might show 0.1% slippage on one exchange but 0.5% on another. That 0.4% difference is $2,000 lost to poor liquidity. Our crypto slippage calculator shows you exactly what each trade will cost across all major exchanges, helping you minimize trading costs.
        - generic [ref=e125]:
          - heading "Which Exchange Has the Best Prices" [level=2] [ref=e126]
          - paragraph [ref=e127]: There's no single answer - it depends on what you're trading and how much. For BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT, Binance usually has the deepest orderbooks. For USD pairs like BTC-USD and ETH-USD, Coinbase and Kraken compete closely. For less common altcoins, liquidity varies significantly. The best exchange for large crypto orders changes based on market conditions, time of day, and recent trading activity. Use our orderbook depth comparison tool to check real-time liquidity before every significant trade.
        - generic [ref=e128]:
          - heading "Built for Crypto Whale Trading" [level=2] [ref=e129]
          - paragraph [ref=e130]: Token Impact was designed for serious traders executing significant volume. Unlike basic price comparison tools, we analyze real orderbook depth to show you exactly what your trade will cost. Enter any quantity - from 1 BTC to 1,000 BTC - and see the true price impact across Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Whether you're a fund manager, OTC desk, or individual whale, our calculator helps you find the best execution venue and avoid unnecessary slippage costs.
