## FAQ

### What is price impact?
Price impact (also called slippage) is the difference between the expected price and the actual execution price when trading. Larger orders "walk the orderbook" and execute at progressively worse prices.

### Why does exchange choice matter for large trades?
Exchanges have different liquidity depths. A $1M BTC trade might cost 0.1% extra on one exchange but 0.5% on another - that's a $4,000 difference.

### How accurate are the calculations?
Very accurate. Token Impact uses real-time orderbook data and simulates walking the book at each price level. Results reflect actual market conditions at query time.

### Is Token Impact free?
Yes, completely free. The service is supported by affiliate partnerships with exchanges.
