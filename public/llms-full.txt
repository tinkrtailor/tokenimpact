## Calculation Methodology

### How Price Impact is Calculated

1. **Fetch orderbook**: Get top 500 levels from each exchange
2. **Walk the book**: For buys, consume asks from lowest to highest; for sells, consume bids from highest to lowest
3. **Calculate fill**: Sum quantity and cost at each level until target quantity is reached
4. **Compute impact**: Compare weighted average fill price to mid-price

### Formula
```
midPrice = (bestBid + bestAsk) / 2
priceImpact = ((avgFillPrice - midPrice) / midPrice) * 100
```

For sells, the formula is inverted (we want higher prices, not lower).

### Limitations
- Orderbook data is a snapshot; real execution may differ
- Does not account for exchange fees
- Assumes immediate market order execution
- Large orders may move the market during execution

## Use Cases

### For Traders
- Find the cheapest exchange for large orders
- Compare liquidity before trading
- Estimate true cost of market orders

### For Whales
- Execute large positions with minimal impact
- Split orders across exchanges
- Monitor liquidity conditions

### For Researchers
- Compare exchange liquidity over time
- Analyze market depth across venues
- Study market microstructure

## FAQ

### What is price impact?
Price impact (also called slippage) is the difference between the expected price and the actual execution price. When you place a market order, you "walk the orderbook" - consuming liquidity at progressively worse prices. The larger your order, the more price levels you consume, and the worse your average fill price.

### Why does exchange choice matter?
Different exchanges have vastly different liquidity depths. A $1M BTC trade might cost 0.1% extra on Coinbase but 0.5% on another exchange - that's a $4,000 difference. For large traders, choosing the right exchange is critical.

### How accurate are the calculations?
Token Impact uses real-time orderbook data and simulates walking the book at each price level. Results reflect actual market conditions at query time. However, orderbooks change constantly, so treat results as estimates.

### Does this include exchange fees?
No. The calculator shows price impact only. You should add the exchange's trading fee (typically 0.1-0.5%) to get total cost.

### What about hidden liquidity?
Some exchanges have hidden orders or iceberg orders that don't appear in the orderbook. Actual execution may be better than the estimate if hidden liquidity exists.

### Is Token Impact free?
Yes, completely free with no signup required. The service is supported by affiliate partnerships with exchanges.

### Can I use the API programmatically?
Yes, the API is public and free to use. Please be respectful with rate limits - roughly 1 request per second is reasonable.
